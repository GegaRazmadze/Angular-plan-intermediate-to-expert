# AngularPlanIntermediateToExpert

This project was created because I couldn't find any source of material about "How to Become an Angular Expert / Professional." As a result, this project will teach you how to become an intermediate Angular Developer, and then an expert.

## The resources used in our strategy  

For plan we need resources:

- Youtube channels: [ng-conf](https://www.youtube.com/c/ngconfonline), [Decoded Frontend](https://www.youtube.com/c/DecodedFrontend)
- Online Courses: intermediate
- Programmers' Social Networks: [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/angular), [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- Blogs About Programming: [Medium](https://medium.com/),

## Actions to carry out our plan  

Plan resources are optional. We need these resources to implement our plan. The idea is to start an Intermediate Online Course(the topic can be anything, depending on what you are interested in or working on). After watching one topic and implementing it parallel to the course (the code will be written in this course), after we search and read some blog articles or watch YouTube Advanced videos about it, after that we write a little essay (this is why [writing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfDOoADCfkg) essay is important, this is the [GUIDE](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://jordanbpeterson.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Essay_Writing_Guide.docx) for writing a great essay about anything.), then we go again.

We will work on it for 6 days a week (if you can, of course; if not, try your best, start with a very small step to trick your lazy mind). Our purpose is to do one of these thingsgit in one day:

- watch tutorial "X"
- reading 1 article from my list
- watching 1 video from my list
- listening to 1 podcast episode
- searching for Angular community events
  Also, once a month, I answer one [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) question. Communication with other programmers and helping them will help you to improve as professional.

# Composition of the project

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
